# Svelte boilerplate

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps.

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`.
